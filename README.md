> A repo for learning more about thinking in R vs Python for data analysis

Thank you for attending this workshop, and I hope you'll learn some new strategies for switching between R and Python!  In this repository, you'll find an example of the same data analysis in R and Python.  We'll use some dataframes that we generate so that we can check the accuracy and increase the speed of development.

## Pre-requisites
During this workshop, we'll mostly be using R Studio and Jupyter notebooks, so make sure you have this installed.

## Target Audience
The target audience is expected to have some experience with data science in both Python (using pandas) and with the tidyverse, particularly dplyr and ggplot.

## Workshop discussion

During the workshop, we'll also have some opportunities for individual/group work to experiment with differences between tidyverse packages and Python data science packages.  Please use this shared document to screenshot your code answers and free response answers.  We'll use this for discussion.
